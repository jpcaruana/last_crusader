How exactly it does this is up to the implementation, such as in the example below of using either a self-encoded token or a database of tokens.

The Post Type Discovery algorithm (&quot;the algorithm&quot;) discovers the type of a post given a data structure representing a post with a flat set of properties (e.g. Activity Streams (1.0 or 2.0) JSON, or JSON output from parsing [microformats2]), each with one or more values, by following these steps until reaching the first &quot;it is a(n) ... post&quot; statement at which point the &quot;...&quot; is the discovered post type. 1. If the post has an &quot;rsvp&quot; property with a valid value, Then it is an RSVP post. 2. If the post has an &quot;in-reply-to&quot; property with a valid URL, Then it is a reply post. 3. If the post has a &quot;repost-of&quot; property with a valid URL, Then it is a repost (AKA &quot;share&quot;) post. 4. If the post has a &quot;like-of&quot; property with a valid URL, Then it is a like (AKA &quot;favorite&quot;) post. 5. If the post has a &quot;video&quot; property with a valid URL, Then it is a video post. 6. If the post has a &quot;photo&quot; property with a valid URL, Then it is a photo post. 7. If the post has a &quot;content&quot; property with a non-empty value, Then use its first non-empty value as the content 8. Else if the post has a &quot;summary&quot; property with a non-empty value, Then use its first non-empty value as the content 9. Else it is a note post. 10. If the post has no &quot;name&quot; property or has a &quot;name&quot; property with an empty string value (or no value) Then it is a note post. 11. Take the first non-empty value of the &quot;name&quot; property 12. Trim all leading/trailing whitespace 13. Collapse all sequences of internal whitespace to a single space (0x20) character each 14.
